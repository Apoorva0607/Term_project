math 5610 term project
This system uses a model with three modules written in Python â€“ vehicle, satellite and receiver. The vehicle generates positional
data, the satellite converts those into the data of the kind processed by GPS receivers, and the receiver converts these back to
positional data which turns into a numerical task of finding the solution to certain nonlinear system of equations.
